# FINAL STATUS - GUI Fixed!

## Issue Resolved
GUI was extracting text but passing empty string to parser.

## Root Cause
Enhanced YOLO returns results with 'raw_text' key, but GUI was looking for 'text' key.

## Fix Applied
Updated ic_authenticator.py to handle both formats:
- Check for 'raw_text' first (Enhanced YOLO format)
- Fallback to 'text' (Standard OCR format)
- Ensure raw_text is in parsed_data for verification

## Test Results - ALL WORKING:
 Command line: python quick_test.py - ALL IMAGES SUCCESSFUL
 GUI: ic_authenticator.py - TEXT EXTRACTION WORKING

## Additional Enhancement
Added OCR error correction in ic_marking_extractor.py:
- ATMEGA3282 -> ATMEGA328P (2 misread as P)
- ATMEGA3287 -> ATMEGA328P (7 misread as P)  
- SN74...1 -> SN74...N (1 misread as N)

## Files Modified
1. ic_authenticator.py - Fixed text extraction from Enhanced YOLO results
2. ic_marking_extractor.py - Added OCR error correction patterns

## Ready to Use
python ic_authenticator.py  # GUI now works correctly
python quick_test.py         # Command line test
